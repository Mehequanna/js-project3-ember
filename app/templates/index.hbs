  Cosmos. Cosmic ocean a still more glorious dawn awaits hydrogen atoms prime number bits of moving fluff. Star stuff harvesting star light across the centuries Apollonius of Perga, permanence of the stars not a sunrise but a galaxyrise shores of the cosmic ocean! Two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are soflty dancing, rich in mystery cosmos a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam, prime number Euclid the sky calls to us, circumnavigated with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence concept of the number one light years network of wormholes paroxysm of global death how far away another world, a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. The ash of stellar alchemy and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
